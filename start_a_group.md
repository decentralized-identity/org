# Starting a group at DIF

Contact: community@identity.foundation

## Decide the group type

First, decide which group type is appropriate for your needs:

- Working Group: IPR-protected group that produces technical specifications or other artifacts. Participants must be DIF members.
- Special Interest Group: Open group serving as a cooperative space to align on common areas of interest and encourage ideation
- User Group: Open group consisting of users interested in a DIF codebase

It's also possible that your idea can be accomplished as a work item in an existing group. See [Participation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/dif_org_faq.md#participation) for more details.

## Fill out and submit a charter proposal

1. Select the appropriate template from DIF's group charter templates (see next section) and make a copy so you can edit it.

## DIF approval

## Provide information needed for launching the group

After approval, DIF staff will contact you requesting the final information needed to set up the group. Copy and fill out [this form template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16L5qhVky6DCf3-0y5_EooAGdpNPlpMi5STKA0KIgHfA/edit#heading=h.qcn49g1ayebb) and return it to DIF.

Your group is now ready to be launched. DIF staff will coordinate with you as needed.
