# Starting a group at DIF

Questions? Contact community@identity.foundation

## Decide the group type

First, decide which group type is appropriate for your needs:

- Working Group: IPR-protected group that produces technical specifications or other artifacts. Participants must be DIF members.
- Special Interest Group: Open group serving as a cooperative space to align on common areas of interest and encourage ideation
- User Group: Open group consisting of users interested in a DIF codebase

It's also possible that your idea can be accomplished as a work item in an existing group. See [Participation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/dif_org_faq.md#participation) for more details.

## Fill out and submit a group proposal

1. Fill out the [group proposal form](https://identity.foundation/propose)
2. Contact community@identity.foundation if you have questions

## DIF approval

DIF staff will work with the steering committee to get approval, and will contact you if there are any questions.

## Provide information needed for launching the group

After approval, DIF staff will contact you requesting the final information needed to set up the group.

## Group launch

Your group is now ready to be launched. DIF staff will coordinate with you as needed.

See [Working Group Lifecycle](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/working-group-lifecycle.md) for additional context.
