# Creating a working group work item

Each DIF working group may have its own process around launch of work items. Once a work item is approved by the working group, a repository for the work item must be created. The following repository templates can be used depending on the specific work item:

- https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-registry-workitems
- https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-profile-workitems
- https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-IETF-bound
- https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-work-items (general purpose for work items not covered above)

After instantiating the repo based on a template, follow the template's readme to continue.

Finally, set up group meetings and recordings (calendar entry, zoom room, recordings)
