# Creating a DIF group

This describes the DIF operational instructions for launching a DIF group. These steps are to be performed by DIF Core Team or appropriate TSC members. This is currently managed through DIF's Airtable.

DIF group types include:

- Working Groups (WGs)
- Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
- User Groups (UGs)

Some steps apply to WGs only.

### Prerequisites

- DIF Steering Committee has approved the group's charter
- DIF Staff has collected chair information (github username, images for site, etc)

### Working Groups Only
- Set the github topic (for tagging group repos)
- Set up group’s work item repo(s), if needed, or transfer in repo. Tag then with the github topic
- Give github access to group chairs in Github teams:
    - Create team for the group and add the chair github aliases
        - Add the appropriate repos
    - Add chairs to TSC github team
- Channels/perms
