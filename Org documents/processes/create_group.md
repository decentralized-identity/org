# Creating a DIF group

This describes the DIF operational instructions for launching a DIF group. These steps are to be performed by DIF Core Team or appropriate TSC members.

DIF group types include:

- Working Groups (WGs)
- Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
- User Groups (UGs)

SIGs and UGs are collectively referred to as Open Groups (OGs)

### Prerequisites

- DIF Steering Committee has approved the group's charter
- Group Chair / Proposer has filled out [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16L5qhVky6DCf3-0y5_EooAGdpNPlpMi5STKA0KIgHfA/edit#heading=h.qcn49g1ayebb)

### Steps

DIF core team or approved person does the following steps:

1. Memorialize charter
   - [**WGs**] Save as PDF and store in "WG documents"
   - [**OGs**] Convert to markdown (will be placed in group’s github repo)
2. Set up group’s landing page by using the appropriate template repo and updating appropriately. Make sure to check "Include all branches", then follow the instructions in the README.md file
   - [**OGs**] Create from [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-OGs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-OGs)
   - [**WGs**] Create from [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-WGs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/template-for-WGs)
3. [**WGs**] Set up group’s [work item repo(s)](create_work_item.md), if needed
4. Give github access to group chairs
   - Create team for the group and add the chair github aliases
5. Set up group meetings and recordings (calendar entry, zoom room, recordings)
6. Add group to DIF web site [Repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io)
   - [**OGs**] The repo hosts the web site, but you still have to link to it from the DIF web site.
   - [**WGs**] Create WG page; [see WG templates](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/blob/master/templates/pages/working-groups/index.html)
7. Set up communication channels
   - [**WGs**] Create slack channel and mailing list
   - [**UGs**, **SIGs**] Create discord channel, mailing list, or other
8. Double-check that group's landing page / README is updated with all links/info
9. Onboard chairs
10. Announce group
