# Addendum to Deliverable Development Process


The following resolutions supplement for the [Project Charter (v4.0.3)](https://bit.ly/DIFProjectCharter_4_0_3) to clarify our process.



---


5 - __Deliverable Development Process__

5.4 -  <u>Editor, Maintainer and/or Code Owner</u> roles MAY be assigned in the github repository/ies of a given work item, but these roles should be publicly codified in contributor guidelines (see 7.2), and may be specific to stages in the deliverable life-cycle.

 The following clarifications expand on the mentioned subsections.


7.1 **Pre-Draft**

1. A Pre-Draft MAY BE referred to as a “Strawman” internally
2. Additional “straw men” can serve as input documents to a Draft Deliverable, in part or in whole, and can be submitted after a Draft has been initiated at the discretion of the chairs

7.2 **Draft**

1. Versioning of specifications or code SHALL apply to every change **affecting normative statements and/or test vectors.**
2. All released versions of a draft SHALL be accessible at a static and **permanent URL**, tracked by DIF. (This is to minimize risk of editorial error or “overwriting” of significant changes).
3. Work items or their groups MAY customize the standard contributor guidelines template.
4. [SemVer.org](www.semver.org)-conformant versioning is the expectation, and if other conventions will be used, guidance should be published in the governing contributor guidelines document.


7.3 **Working Group Approved Draft**

1. Where protocols or interfaces are being specified, a section explicitly defining test vectors for conformance testing SHALL be written at time of approving a draft or earlier.
2. Approved drafts should be put at a permanent link tracked on DIF's website or github.



7.4 **Final approval**

5. Final approval by DIF is referred to as “DIF Ratified Deliverable or DIF Ratified Specification” internally
6. The steering committee MAY invite external review of test vectors and normative statements at this point, regardless of whether the Draft will proceed to step 7.6 or only to step 7.5
