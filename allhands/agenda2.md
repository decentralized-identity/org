### Agenda

1. **Welcome and introductions**
    - New format, less meeting more update 
2. **Groups**

| ID | CC | DIDAuth | DIDcomm | SDS | Sidetree | KERI | WalletSec |Crypto|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Interop**|**Prod managers**|**H&T SIG**|**Finance SIG**|**APAC/ASEA**|**Africa**| | | |


   * **Interop WG** (Kaliya, Pamela, Juan) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md)
       * Chair election - ongoing, please vote (if you are at least somewhat active in the group) using this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScG2mHq8bS9K8GXgLhjoJ4tbgMtnILMkzIK_CSv-cTRPGcdrw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0)
       * John Jordan - the ToIP vision and governance for decentralized identity
       * SSI and "eIDAS 2.0"
           * Martin Boender from Sphereon, Xavier from ValidatedID, Samuel from Gataca, and other guests 
           * EBSI is this about roots of trust or trust frameworks?
               * EBSI: European Blockchain Services Infrastructure
           * eIDAS 1.0 was Defining eIDs in a way that allows crossborder interop, 
               * Only 14/27 member states implemented
               * Protocol-level interactions were never really defined;  wallet controlling one of those eIDs doesn't have requirements or capabilities
               * Adoption stalled in many of those 14 countries- <5% of population in most of the 14 actually have and use these eIDs/eSigs
               * crossborder recognition was public-sector only 
           * the EU digital id & VC-holding wallets and EBSI should be seen as two distinct movements,
           * Memberstates still can chose to adopt, or fork, or betray whatever EBSI does 
               * could be interop nightmare
               *  chaos of independent implementations across EU is what they want to avoid this time around
           *  interop on what layer?
               *  DID layer is easy because did:ebsi; semantics/LD/ontology layer is what the universities are focusing on;
           *  here is the [EBSI documentation homepage](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EBSIDOC/EBSI+Documentation+Home) that gets updated regularly
       *  Report from the OIDF working groups with David Waite and Kristina Yasuda
           *  history of the past 12 years in identity world
               *  OAuth1, Oauth2, Keybase etc. 
           *  "Different kind of trust, can anchor with more sources of identity."
               *  Original OpenIDI didn't stop blog spam, because spammers could host their own OpenID providers. Could block them, but no reputation. Keybase no way to verify email addresses because no social network, no way to collaborate and share information. Twitter/LinkedIn could hypothetically verified my employment history, Keybase didn't get there. Didn't standardize their cryptography beyond PGP until Zoom bought them
           *  With SIOP, you do self-generated and pairwise keys - ephemeral, not rooted to anything. Like AuthN - doesn't prove relation with other things on internet, becomes Privacy-preserving: unlinkable. Can prove it's me: authentication.
           *   proposal on OpenID connect on verifiable presentations.
           *   Idea of user record in hosted application in single table demolished by authentication over the years.
           *   FIDO, WebAuthN: authenticators registered with account: have to be stored so can use them later.
           *   one of reasons I think that "Sign in with Google" is so attractive is that I expect their Google account to outlast my account - so I don't have to do recovery. 
           *   OIDF Interest in using VP as recovery scheme.
               *    e.g. using American driver license, issued by state, and can present it. Even if no attributes, if it has a pseudonymous identifiers, it enables me to log in. If they have documents, those become verifiable.
               *   If shared at registration time, becomes source of registration for recovery.
               *   to recover, lost trust relationship, restarting process, go through process costing companies a lot. If can use VP, that can help reestablish the trust relationship, can save calling, asking for secret questions, Mom's name, etc. 
           *   OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations
               *   Previous term: portable identifiers. For existing hosted provider, is there a way to include/assert DID ownership in challenge with other parties
           *   OpenID Connect Aggregated and Distributed Claims
               *   upstream credentials without defined retrieval mechanism. Potential overlap with Credential Manifest
           *   how to transport VP. Larger demand on transferring VP using any model, not just SIOP. What if Google wants to send a VP on behalf of me, based on access token.
               *   1: embed VP entirely in the id token
               *   2: send back VP from user endpoint
           *   company specific implementations how to use the spec stack 
       *   NFC support - Passport NFC
   * **Identifiers & Discovery** (Markus, Alen) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md)
       * new time for UR calls, Wednesday 2 pm CET (8 am ET) as mostly european countries atten it
       * [Alen] EBSI Ledger and Trust 
            * European Blockchain Service Infrastructure
            * List of Trusted Registries
            * Registry Properties
            * Discussion about "Onboarding Service"
            * Discussion LoA, key security, eIDAS
            * Current Status of EBSI
        * [Daniel] Historical key resolution
           * A DID document could point to a hub, which contains a list of historical keys associated with the DID. This list is signed by a current DID controller key.
           * Using DID URLs, it should be possible to point to a specific historical key at a specific point in time, and it can be dereferences publicly by anyone.
           * See https://identity.foundation/identity-hub/spec/#did-relative-urls
           * Discussion around how can this be trusted
           * Advantage: This is method-independent.
           * Discussion on relation between this approach and KERI's Key Event Logs.
           * Discussion on implementing this in the Universal Resolver. 
           * The ID WG could start a new work item which defines the data structure of historical keys, as well as the format of DID URls that point to them.
       * Universal Resolver returning a key in a given format (e.g., JWK(S))
            * Discussions on [transform-keys DID URL parameter](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/transform-keys.md).
            * Specification is incomplete and needs more work. PoC has been implemented in Universal Resolver.
            * Parameter is registered in DID Spec Registries (which is a "note", not a "standard").
            * Discussion on trust boundaries and security implications of transforming keys in a DID document (only public keys!)
            * What are possible values? JWK, JWKS, base58, multibase, PEM, ...?
            * Discussion on this approach vs. use media types as in https://did.key.transmute.industries/.
       * discussion around Solid and DIDs

        * how to define ‚ÄúKERI-specific‚Äù subset of general-purpose version of CESR-- let‚Äôs start descriptively and address that later, though, it‚Äôs a big problem
        * input to the CESR spec might be [this straw man](https://hackmd.io/@dhuseby/BkG-4gp2u)
        * CESAR doesn‚Äôt work in strictly-typed languages; it was hard to implement in Rust

       *  Why do you need DIDs for SSI, with guest David Chadwick *(Verifiable Credentials Ltd., UK)*
           *  [CCG Thread](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Jun/0023.html) on VCs with non-DID identifiers: a recurring issue in this group!
           *  x509 as issuer ; "DID" for holder to express a key (did:key like encoding from [IETF RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519))
           *  "Protocols for VCs should not presume DIDs"
       *  [Good Health Pass](https://www.goodhealthpass.org/) Blueprint by Drummond Reed, Global Covid Certificate Network by Lucy Yang.
           *  Good Health Pass [Report and Interop Profile](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process) out now-- draft requested before 17 June

 * **Identifiers & Discovery** (Markus, Alen) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md)
     * "controller" property in DID documents and verification methods.
         * "controller" on the top level seems clear, but on the "verificationMethod" is less clear.
         * "verificationMethod" can only have a single "controller", but verification methods can in fact be "controlled" by multiple entities (e.g. see the next topic - Verifiable Conditions)
         * See e.g. https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/697
         * practice we always have `did_document.id === did_document.verificationMethod[N].controller`
     * Updates from Verifiable Conditions - https://github.com/w3c-ccg/verifiable-conditions
       * We discussed https://github.com/w3c-ccg/verifiable-conditions/issues/3
       * Preference for second option ("Manu's proposal")
   * Review of [transform-keys DID parameter](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/transform-keys.md)
       * Outdated in various ways (e.g. matrix parameters, "publicKey" property), needs to be updated to match latest DID Core
   * Discussion on DHS request for comments on mDL:
       * [Minimum Standards for Driver's Licenses and Identification Cards Acceptable by Federal Agencies for Official Purposes; Mobile Driver's Licenses
](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/04/19/2021-07957/minimum-standards-for-drivers-licenses-and-identification-cards-acceptable-by-federal-agencies-for)
