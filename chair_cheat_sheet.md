### Tools and tips for Working Group Chairs:

- ### New member onboarding 
    - Any company or individual who is interested in joining DIF to contribute MUST first sign one of the legal forms of affiliation (Associate, Contributor, Feedback Agreement) according to their status and budget. Once they finalize this document all necessary information will be forwarded to them via a welcome email, including the WG charters etc. 
        - Associate member - paid dif member. Any company over 1000 employees can only choose this option.
        - Contributor - non-paid dif member. Companies under 1000 employees can decided between this or Associate
        - Feedback Agreement - only for individuals who are not employed

- ### Setting up new WG 
    - Any two DIF members can initiate a new working item or group. (further information on the linked GitHub page) 
    - For IPR-protectable material, it is best to incubate the project within an already existing WG until it reaches a level of maturity and contributing circle. 
    - [Life Cycle](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/working-group-lifecycle.md)
- ### New chair election/nomination 
    - If a DIF wg chair steps down, the WG can nominate new chairs. The preferred method for electing the new chair is via consensus. If there is no consensus within the group then voting must be organized - rules for the voting process are in DIF's charter. 
    - A chair can not replace her/himself with a colleague. A nomination must take place and the group should follow consensus/voting process. 
    - As DIF is a place for collaboration, acknowledging work funded or done by others is a gesture to recognize the efforts behind ratified work items. Consider creating a section for acknowledgments and recognize specific grants, people, or organizations whose work is invaluable for the delivered work item.
